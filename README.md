### Churn Overview
- 26.54% churn rate (7,043 total customers)
- $16M in lost revenue from churned customers
- $456.11 average monthly charge per customer

### Customer Segmentation
- Young customers (60%) churn at 3x the rate of seniors (20%)
- Only 1,142 seniors vs 5,901 young customers

### Contract Types:
- Month-to-month contracts have highest churn (5.3M charges lost)
- Two-year contracts most stable (6.3M retained charges)

### Payment Methods:
- Electronic check users dominate churn (4.7M charges lost)
- Bank transfers most reliable (4.9M retained)

### Demographics:
- Gender balanced (M/F near 50-50)
- Customers without dependents churn more (70% vs 50%)
- Paperless billing correlates with higher churn (59%)

## Conclusion
- Customers on month-to-month contracts, younger users, and those using electronic checks or fiber optic internet are more likely to churn. Lack of engagement with services like online backup and streaming also correlates with higher churn. These patterns highlight key areas for improving retention strategies and enhancing the customer experience.
